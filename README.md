# ABOUT THE PROJECT
Our team developed a predictive model to identify users' preferred communication channels, such as email, social media, and web platforms. The project utilized a detailed dataset encompassing event attendance records, communication channel effectiveness (including MailChimp, LinkedIn, and the website), and user preferences across different seasons and industries. This data was instrumental in analyzing audience engagement and preferences for developing the predictive model.

# PROJECT WORKFLOW
Below is an overview of the steps for this project :

**Business Problem :** Focusing on enhancing the effectiveness of communication strategies within the 3D printing healthcare sector.

**SWOT Analysis:** Conducted a comprehensive SWOT analysis to understand the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to 3D printing in healthcare.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed an in-depth exploratory data analysis to gain insights from the dataset, including attendance trends, channel preferences, and topic interests over time.

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the data by removing duplicates, correcting entry errors, and handling missing values.

**Feature Selection:** Employed Lasso regularization to identify the most significant features for predicting the preferred communication channel.

**Modeling:** Developed predictive models using Multinomial Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms to forecast the preferred communication channels of users.

**Model Comparison and Selection**: Compared the performance of all models based on accuracy and F1 score to select the best-performing model.

**Observations & Findings:** Documented key observations and findings from the modeling process, highlighting the most important features for prediction.

**Recommendations and Further Research:** Provided strategic recommendations based on the project's findings and outlined areas for further research and improvement.
